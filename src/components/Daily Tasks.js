// TODO:
// √=[alt+v]
//* - Create login/sign up page (potentially could be one component)
//  - (√) Clicking login/signup on header will show form... Could Browser Router do this?
//  - () Store the login form input values as logged in user
//  - () If signing up, invoke createUser() with input values, and then store as logged in user
//* - If we get some kind of login working -> then create JWT auth
//* - Implement Browser Router
//* - Figure out what view images is for? -> Bootstrap carousel?
// -> (motivational quote API, image uploading, slideshow/carousel)
//* TimeStamps readable

//? Stretch Goals:
// Active Model serializer!
// refactor code -> moving state to only component that needs it... example: Board.js has state of Goals and Images, fetch in './Board'
// Find a way to have cards stacked on each other, and when individual card is clicked, show the larger card(with goals and flippable) to the right
