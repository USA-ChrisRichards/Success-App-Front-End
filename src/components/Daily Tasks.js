//purely for notes...
// TODO:

//* - Create login/sign up page (potentially could be one component)
//* - If we get some kind of login working -> then create JWT auth
//* - Figure out what view images is for? -> Bootstrap carousel?
// -> (motivational quote API, image uploading, slideshow/carousel)
//* TimeStamps readable

//? Stretch Goals:
// Active Model serializer!
// refactor code -> moving state to only component that needs it... example: Board.js has state of Goals and Images, fetch in './Board'
